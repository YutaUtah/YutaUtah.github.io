This is my class porject at Lawrence University. I got deeper understanding of statistical modeling(T-test, AIC, ANOVA etc.,)

This is time series analysis for **TSLA's stock data**. I used R in this project. This task includes data cleaning using **dplyr** and data visualization using **ggplot2**.
