I recently graduated from [Lawrence University](http://lawrence.edu) in Appleton, WI majoring in Mathematics and minoring in Physics and Anthropology. I am the one that excels at explanatory analysis, data visualizations, and machine learning.  

I grew up in Tokyo, Japan and graduated from [Shiba Senior High School](https://www.shiba.ac.jp/).

My hobby includes playing soccer. I played for [Lawrence University Men's Soccer Team](http://vikings.lawrence.edu/sports/msoc/index)!
